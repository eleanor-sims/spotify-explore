# Installation
There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python. The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.

# Project Motivation
For this project, I was interested in using Spotify tracks data from 1922 to 2021 and artist data snapshot of over 1 million artists. The questions I was interested in answering were:

1.  Which genres have the biggest fanbases?
2.  How have audio features of music changed over time?
3.  Which audio features have the biggest impact on popularity?


# File Descriptions
The code for this project is contained in a single Jupyter (ipynb) notebook. This code works sequentially through all steps of the data science process, which are clearly signposted by markdown cells.

# Results
The main findings of the code can be found at the post available  [here](https://medium.com/@elly.sims24/three-things-i-learned-from-exploring-spotify-data-as-a-music-fanatic-57cbb57e361b).
